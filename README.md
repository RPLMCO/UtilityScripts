This is a collection of scripts for managing scrapers

**Summary**

- `jsongen.rb` Generates JSONs using a schema you specify. Can be used for 
anything, but it's good for making machine-readable lists of search terms
- `linkedin.rb` Runs the LinkedIn scraper on a set of search terms in a json
- `crypto` Encrypt and decrypt all files in a directory with GPG
- `config` Scripts for setup and syncing a scraping machine

### Detailed Instructions

1. Run `ruby jsongen.rb`

Currently this only supports single level JSONs.

To Run:

1. Run `ruby json.rb`
2. Follow the directions to manually input the schema and items
3. Stop adding items by adding an item with all blank fields

linkedin.rb

To run this, you need a JSON where every item has the following fields:
Search Term: The phrase you want to search for
Degrees: The number of degrees you want to go out with "people also viewed"

To Run:

1. Run `ruby linkedin.rb`
2. When prompted, type in the name of the file with the search terms
3. When prompted, type in the name of the directory where you want to save
results
4. Wait. A new .json and .csv file will be generated for each search term
